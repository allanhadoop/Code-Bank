- dump - Creates backup archives of whole disk partitions or selected directories.
- restore - Can be used to restore an entire archive or individual files from an archive to the hard drive.
- rmt - A program used by the dump and restore commands to copy files across the network. You should never need to use this command directly.

# dump options arguments filesystem
# see options , arguments etc at link above

Options- 
0-9    - The dump level. Selecting a dump level of 0 backs up all files (a full dump). A higher number backs up only those files modified 
since the last dump of an equal or lower number (in essence, an incremental dump). The default dump level is 9.

-B records - The number of dump records per volume. Basically, the amount of data you can fit on a tape. This option takes a numeric 
argument.

-b kbperdump - The number of kilobytes per dump record. Useful in combination with the -B option.
 
-h level - Files can be marked with a nodump attribute. This option specifies the dump level at or above which the nodump attribute is 
honored. This option takes a numeric argument of 1-9.

-f file  - The name of the file or device to write the dump to. This can even be a file or device on a remote machine.

-d density - Sets the tape density. The default is 1600 bits per inch


-t date - Specify a date and time on which to base incremental backups. Any files modified or added after that time will be backed up. 
This option causes dump to ignore the /etc/dumpdates file. It takes a single argument, a date in the format specified by the ctime man 
page.

-W  - This option causes dump to list the file systems that need to be backed up. It does this by looking at the /etc/dumpdates file 
and the /etc/fstab file.

-w - This works like the W option but lists the individual files that should be backed up.

-------------------------------------------------
# dump 0uBf 500000 /dev/qft0 /dev/hda6

This command results in dump performing a level zero (full) backup of the /dev/hda6 file system, storing the backup on the tape drive 
/dev/qft0, and recording the results in /etc/dumpdates. The B option is used to increase the expected tape block count to 500000; 
otherwise, dump would prompt for a new tape far earlier than required. The dump command prints status messages to the screen, letting you
know how far along the backup has progressed and estimating how much time it will take to complete.
