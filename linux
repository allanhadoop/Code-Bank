at                  - The at job control command executes a given set of commands at a specified time. Superficially, it resembles cron, however, at is chiefly useful for one-time execution of a command set.
fg, bg              - The fg command switches a job running in the background into the foreground. The bg command restarts a suspended job, and runs it in the background. If no job number is specified, then the fg or bg command acts upon the currently running job
cal                 - Prints a neatly formatted monthly calendar to stdout
caller              - Putting a caller command inside a function echoes to stdout information about the caller of that function.
chattr              - Change file attributes.E.g. chattr +i filename marks the file as immutable. The file cannot be modified, linked to, or deleted, not even by root. 
chgrp               - changes the group ownership of a file or files.

egrep               - extended grep -- is the same as grep -E. This uses a somewhat different, extended set of Regular Expressions, which can make the search a bit more flexible. It also allows the boolean | (or) operator.  
                      e.g.>> $ egrep 'matches|Matches' file.txt
enable              - This either enables or disables a shell builtin command. As an example, enable -n kill disables the shell builtin kill, so that when Bash subsequently encounters kill, it invokes the external command /bin/kill.  
enscript            - Utility for converting plain text file to PostScript  
exec                -   This shell builtin replaces the current process with a specified command. Normally, when the shell encounters a command, it forks off a child process to actually execute the command. Using the exec builtin, the shell does not fork, and the command exec'ed replaces the shell. When used in a script, therefore, it forces an exit from the script when the exec'ed command terminates.
exit                - Unconditionally terminates a script. The exit command may optionally take an integer argument, which is returned to the shell as the exit status of the script. example exit 0 or exit $?  
export              - The export [4] command makes available variables to all child processes of the running script or shell. One important use of the export command is in startup files, to initialize and make accessible environmental variables to subsequent user processes.  
expr                - All-purpose expression evaluator: Concatenates and evaluates the arguments according to the operation given (arguments must be separated by spaces). Operations may be arithmetic, comparison, string, or logical.  
                      e.g expr 3 + 5              # 8
factor              - Decompose an integer into prime factors.

pidof               - Identifies process ID (PID) of a running job
ping                - Broadcast an ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packet to another machine, either on a local or remote network
pushd, popd, dirs   - pushd dir-name pushes the path dir-name onto the directory stack (to the top of the stack) and simultaneously changes the current working directory to dir-name
                    - popd removes (pops) the top directory path name off the directory stack and simultaneously changes the current working directory to the directory now at the top of the stack.
                    - dirs lists the contents of the directory stack
procinfo            - Extract and list information and statistics from the /proc pseudo-filesystem.
ps                  - Process Statistics: lists currently executing processes by owner and PID (process ID). This is usually invoked with ax or aux options, and may be piped to grep or sed to search for a specific process
                      bash$  ps ax | grep sendmail
                      295 ?	   S	  0:00 sendmail: accepting connections on port 25
pwd                 - Print Working Directory
quota               - Display user or group disk quotas.
rcp                 - Remote copy, copies files between two different networked machines.
read                - "Reads" the value of a variable from stdin, that is, interactively fetches input from the keyboard
readlink            - Disclose the file that a symbolic link points to.
readonly            - Same as declare -r, sets a variable as read-only, or, in effect, as a constant.
reset               - Reset terminal parameters and clear text screen. 
dump, restore       - The dump command is an elaborate filesystem backup utility, generally used on larger installations and networks. [6] It reads raw disk partitions and writes a backup file in a binary format. Files to be backed up may be saved to a variety of storage media, including disks and tape drives. The restore command restores backups made with dump
rev                 - reverses each line of a file, and outputs to stdout
rm                  - Delete (remove) a file or files. The -f option forces removal of even readonly files
rmdir               - Remove directory. The directory must be empty of all files -- including "invisible" dotfiles [2] -- for this command to succeed.
route               - Show info about or make changes to the kernel routing table.
rpm                 - The Red Hat Package Manager, or rpm utility provides a wrapper for source or binary archives. It includes commands for installing and checking the integrity of packages, among other things
rsync               - Remote synchronize, updates (synchronizes) files between two different networked machines.
runlevel            - Shows the current and last runlevel, that is, whether the system is halted (runlevel 0), in single-user mode (1), in multi-user mode (2 or 3), in X Windows (5), or rebooting (6). This command accesses the /var/run/utmp file.
run-parts           - The run-parts command [1] executes all the scripts in a target directory
scp                 - Secure copy, similar in function to rcp, copies files between two different networked machines, but does so using authentication, and with a security level similar to ssh
sdiff               - Compare and/or edit two files in order to merge them into an output file. Because of its interactive nature, this command would find little use in a script.
sed                 - a non-interactive text file editor. It receives text input, whether from stdin or from a file, performs certain operations on specified lines of the input, one line at a time, then outputs the result to stdout or to a file.
service             - Starts or stops a system service. The startup scripts in /etc/init.d and /etc/rc.d use this command to start services at bootup.
set                 - The set command changes the value of internal script variables/options.
getfacl, setfacl    - These commands retrieve or set the file access control list -- the owner, group, and file permissions.
setquota            - Set user or group disk quotas from the command-line
setserial           - Set or display serial port parameters
shopt               - This command permits changing shell options on the fly
shred               - Securely erase a file by overwriting it multiple times with random bit patterns before deleting it.
sleep               - This is the shell equivalent of a wait loop. It pauses for a specified number of seconds, doing nothing.
sort                - File sort utility, often used as a filter in a pipe. This command sorts a text stream or file forwards or backwards
source              - This command, when invoked from the command-line, executes a script
split, csplit       - These are utilities for splitting a file into smaller chunks. csplit command splits a file according to context, the split occuring where patterns are matched.
sq                  - compression (squeeze) utility
ssh                 - Secure shell, logs onto a remote host and executes commands there. This secure replacement for telnet, rlogin, rcp, and rsh uses identity authentication and encryption
stat                - Gives detailed and verbose statistics on a given file (even a directory or device file) or set of files.
strace              - System trace: diagnostic and debugging tool for tracing system calls and signals.
strings             - Use the strings command to find printable strings in a binary or data file
strip               - Remove the debugging symbolic references from an executable binary. This decreases its size, but makes debugging it impossible.
suspend             - This has a similar effect to Control-Z, but it suspends the shell (the shell's parent process should resume it at an appropriate time).
tac                 - This is the inverse of cat command, listing a file backwards from its end.
tail                - lists the (tail) end of a file to stdout. The default is 10 lines
tar                 - The standard UNIX archiving utility
