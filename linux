Gawk                - This is the GNU Project's version of the AWK programming language.
bzip2               - A portable, fast, open source program used to compress and decompress files at a high rate
echo                - it allows a user to repeat
enable              - will stop or start printers or classes. E.g. enable printer-name
env                 - It runs a program in a modified environment or displays the current environment and its variables. e.g.To set environment variable.  env LOGPATH=/var/log
eval                - Combines the arguments in an expression or list of expressions and evaluates them. Any variables within the expression are expanded. The net result is to convert a string into a command.
                        a='$b'
                        b='$c'

at                  - The at job control command executes a given set of commands at a specified time. Superficially, it resembles cron, however, at is chiefly useful for one-time execution of a command set.
fg, bg              - The fg command switches a job running in the background into the foreground. The bg command restarts a suspended job, and runs it in the background. If no job number is specified, then the fg or bg command acts upon the currently running job
cal                 - Prints a neatly formatted monthly calendar to stdout
caller              - Putting a caller command inside a function echoes to stdout information about the caller of that function.
chattr              - Change file attributes.E.g. chattr +i filename marks the file as immutable. The file cannot be modified, linked to, or deleted, not even by root. 
chgrp               - changes the group ownership of a file or files.
chkconfig           - Check network and system configuration. This command lists and manages the network and system services started at bootup in the /etc/rc?.d directory.
chroot              - Change ROOT directory. Normally commands are fetched from $PATH, relative to /, the default root directory. 
sum, cksum, md5sum, sha1sum -- These are utilities for generating checksums. A checksum is a number [3] mathematically calculated from the contents of a file, for the purpose of checking its integrity.
cmp                 - The cmp command is a simpler version of diff, above. Whereas diff reports the differences between two files, cmp merely shows at what point they differ.
column              - Column formatter. This filter transforms list-type text output into a "pretty-printed" table by inserting tabs at appropriate places.
comm                - Versatile file comparison utility. The files must be sorted for this to be useful.
command             - The command directive disables aliases and functions for the command immediately following it.
compgen             - This builtin expands a list of arguments to generate completion matches.
complete            - The Bash complete and compgen builtins make it possible for tab completion to recognize partial parameters and options to commands. In a very simple case, we can use complete from the command-line to specify a short list of acceptable parameters.
gzip                - compression utility 
coproc              - builtin enables two parallel processes to communicate and interact
openssl             - This is an Open Source implementation of Secure Sockets Layer encryption
split, csplit       - These are utilities for splitting a file into smaller chunks. Their usual use is for splitting up large files in order to back them up on floppies or preparatory to e-mailing or uploading them.
cut                 - A tool for extracting fields from files. It is similar to the print $N command set in awk, but more limited.
declare             - The declare or typeset builtins, which are exact synonyms, permit modifying the properties of variables
