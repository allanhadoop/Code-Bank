at                  - The at job control command executes a given set of commands at a specified time. Superficially, it resembles cron, however, at is chiefly useful for one-time execution of a command set.
fg, bg              - The fg command switches a job running in the background into the foreground. The bg command restarts a suspended job, and runs it in the background. If no job number is specified, then the fg or bg command acts upon the currently running job
cal                 - Prints a neatly formatted monthly calendar to stdout
caller              - Putting a caller command inside a function echoes to stdout information about the caller of that function.
chattr              - Change file attributes.E.g. chattr +i filename marks the file as immutable. The file cannot be modified, linked to, or deleted, not even by root. 
chgrp               - changes the group ownership of a file or files.
chkconfig           - Check network and system configuration. This command lists and manages the network and system services started at bootup in the /etc/rc?.d directory.
chroot              - Change ROOT directory. Normally commands are fetched from $PATH, relative to /, the default root directory. 
sum, cksum, md5sum, sha1sum -- These are utilities for generating checksums. A checksum is a number [3] mathematically calculated from the contents of a file, for the purpose of checking its integrity.
cmp                 - The cmp command is a simpler version of diff, above. Whereas diff reports the differences between two files, cmp merely shows at what point they differ.
column              - Column formatter. This filter transforms list-type text output into a "pretty-printed" table by inserting tabs at appropriate places.
comm                - Versatile file comparison utility. The files must be sorted for this to be useful.
command             - The command directive disables aliases and functions for the command immediately following it.
compgen             - This builtin expands a list of arguments to generate completion matches.
complete            - The Bash complete and compgen builtins make it possible for tab completion to recognize partial parameters and options to commands. In a very simple case, we can use complete from the command-line to specify a short list of acceptable parameters.
gzip                - compression utility 
coproc              - builtin enables two parallel processes to communicate and interact
openssl             - This is an Open Source implementation of Secure Sockets Layer encryption
split, csplit       - These are utilities for splitting a file into smaller chunks. Their usual use is for splitting up large files in order to back them up on floppies or preparatory to e-mailing or uploading them.
cut                 - A tool for extracting fields from files. It is similar to the print $N command set in awk, but more limited.
declare or typeset  - This builtins, which are exact synonyms, permit modifying the properties of variables
                    n=6/3
                    echo "n = $n"       # n = 6/3

                    declare -i n
                    n=6/3
                    echo "n = $n"       # n = 2
  
dialog              - It offers a method of calling "dialog" widgets from a shell script.

dig                 - It  does an Internet name server lookup on a host similar to nslookup 
dirname             - Strips the basename from a filename, printing only the path information.  
disown              - Remove job(s) from the shell's table of active jobs.  
dmesg               - Lists all system bootup messages to stdout  
du                  - Show (disk) file usage, recursively. Defaults to current working directory, unless otherwise specified.
dump, restore       - The dump command is an elaborate filesystem backup utility, generally used on larger installations and networks. [6] It reads raw disk partitions and writes a backup file in a binary format. Files to be backed up may be saved to a variety of storage media, including disks and tape drives. The restore command restores backups made with dump        
fsck, e2fsck, debugfs --Filesystem check, repair, and debug command set.  
egrep               - extended grep -- is the same as grep -E. This uses a somewhat different, extended set of Regular Expressions, which can make the search a bit more flexible. It also allows the boolean | (or) operator.  
                      e.g.>> $ egrep 'matches|Matches' file.txt
enable              - This either enables or disables a shell builtin command. As an example, enable -n kill disables the shell builtin kill, so that when Bash subsequently encounters kill, it invokes the external command /bin/kill.  
enscript            - Utility for converting plain text file to PostScript  
exec                -   This shell builtin replaces the current process with a specified command. Normally, when the shell encounters a command, it forks off a child process to actually execute the command. Using the exec builtin, the shell does not fork, and the command exec'ed replaces the shell. When used in a script, therefore, it forces an exit from the script when the exec'ed command terminates.
exit                - Unconditionally terminates a script. The exit command may optionally take an integer argument, which is returned to the shell as the exit status of the script. example exit 0 or exit $?  
export              - The export [4] command makes available variables to all child processes of the running script or shell. One important use of the export command is in startup files, to initialize and make accessible environmental variables to subsequent user processes.  
expr                - All-purpose expression evaluator: Concatenates and evaluates the arguments according to the operation given (arguments must be separated by spaces). Operations may be arithmetic, comparison, string, or logical.  
                      e.g expr 3 + 5              # 8
factor              - Decompose an integer into prime factors. 
                    bash$ factor 27417
                    27417: 3 13 19 37
false               - A command that returns an unsuccessful exit status, but does nothing else.
fdisk               - Create or change a partition table on a storage device, usually a hard drive. This command must be invoked as root.
file                - A utility for identifying file types. The command file file-name will return a file specification for file-name, such as ascii text or data. e.g. ASCII text
find                - Carries out COMMAND on each file that find matches. 
                    eg. find ~/Desktop/ -name '*.jpg'  
                    eg. find ~/ -name 'core*' -exec rm {} \;      # Removes all core dump files from user's home directory.
finger              - Retrieve information about users on a network
flock , lockfile    - It sets an "advisory" lock on a file and then executes a command while the lock is on. This is to prevent any other process from setting a lock on that file until completion of the specified command
free                - Shows memory and cache usage in tabular form
procinfo            - Shows all the information that free does, and much more

fuser               - Identifies the processes (by PID) that are accessing a given file, set of files, or directory
getfacl, setfacl    - These commands retrieve or set the file access control list -- the owner, group, and file permissions.
getopts             - This powerful tool parses command-line arguments passed to the script. 
getty, agetty       - The initialization process for a terminal uses getty or agetty to set it up for login by a user.
grep                - A multi-purpose file search tool that uses Regular Expressions
groupmod            - Modify a given group.
