# Objective of the code - Main objective of the code is to parse URL from the web and perform following actions 
# Website may consists of text; images ;hyperlinks etc. 
   1. First connect to the weblink using request module as shown using REQUEST 
   2. Once connected to weblink, get only text from the website data 
# Convert text into string using STR function
# Perform data filtering of the data using Beautifulsoup class/module as shown 
  1. You can filter data based on various tags e.g.  filter using 'a' or '<p' or '<div' etc 
  2. Further fitering can be done if more matching data found using conditional IF statement as shown
# Once data is filtered then build separate function to clean data. 
  1. Data can be cleansed using multiple techqniue . Here are few mentioned
      a. Either capture exception on the string as shown
      b. Check if incoming word has any of the alphabet character e.g. 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVXYZ' and then perform loop to eliminate junk
# Once data is cleansed , it can be posted to final list of printed as required
